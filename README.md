Kløkt is an advanced, adaptive media encoding pipeline orchestrator built upon the CONCEPT (Collaborative Operability, Naming, Configuration, Externalization, Profiling, Testing) AI framework. Embodying the shrewdness of its name, Kløkt intelligently manages complex AV1 workflows by performing per-scene analysis to accurately type the media, thereby determining the most efficient encoding strategy. It incorporates deep situational awareness, optimizing operations based on real-time factors including electrical rates, ambient temperature, and scheduling inputs from systems like Home Assistant. Kløkt ensures both superior quality and maximum resource efficiency, acting as the clever, self-governing intelligence layer for modern media processing.
